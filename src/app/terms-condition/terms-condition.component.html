With its publication, the User is obligated to accept and complete the transactions specified within the Terms and Conditions of StubHub. 
                 <p>The publication of an Offer on the Website also implies the formalization of the work order agreement and the beginning of the Service provided to the Seller by StubHub. Upon the acceptance the Offer by the Buyer, this Service earns fees, and in the case of non-compliance of the contract terms StubHub shall receive compensation. 
                 <p>This Service will yield commissions, and if necessary, economic penalisation for non-compliance in favour of StubHub, once the Buyer has accepted the Offer. Additionally, StubHub has the right to claim loss and damages when appropriate. 
                 <h4>3.3. Term of validity and applicability of published Offers.</h4>

                 <h4>3.4. Publication Free of Charge.</h4>
                 <p>The publication of the Offer is free of charge for the Seller.

                 <h4>3.6. Taxes associated with the transaction of Tickets.</h4>
                 <p>If the Tickets are subject to duties or taxes, it is the responsibility of the Sellers to determine their kind and amount so as to include them in the final cession price.

Determination of the price is the sole responsibility of the Seller and StubHub will take no part in this determination, having no influence whatsoever in the determination of offered prices. 
                 <p>In consequence, the price will be set freely by the Seller who must bear in mind the stipulations of paragraph 3.6 regarding taxes associated with the transaction, and, the fee of the Service offered by StubHub in accordance with paragraph 3.8. The Seller may, at any time until the acceptance of their Offer by a Buyer, modify the desired price offered for the transaction. 
                 <h4>3.8. Cost of the Service to Offer Tickets.</h4>
                 <p>The use of the Website by a Seller to make Offers accrues the cost of the Service in favour of StubHub for all transactions effectively carried out through the Website. This cost of the Services rendered by StubHub will be determined in the following fashion: 
                
                 <h4>3.9. Linking the Seller to an accepted Offer.</h4>
                 <p>Once StubHub has sent the first email to the Seller informing them that, depending on the case, the sale is pending or confirmed, the Offer cannot be withdrawn or modified, and the Seller must save the Tickets at the disposal of the Buyer. Once a transaction on an Offer is accepted by the Buyer StubHub will send an email confirming the sale and the Seller must carry out the transaction in a manner that the Buyer may make effective use of the acquired Tickets.  
                 <p>All sales are final. StubHub will not be held responsible for the conditions of the events taking place, any possible change of venue, scheduling, line-up, or any cancellation of the event that might occur. If the situations detailed in the previous paragraph were to take place, cancellation of payments due from the completion of transactions will only be done by discretion of StubHub. 
                 <h4>3.10. Non-compliance by the Seller. Penalisations:</h4>
                 <p>StubHub will apply economic penalties in the form of financial charges to Sellers of transactions which are not successfully completed due to error or non-compliance by the Seller of the Tickets. These charges reflect the costs incurred by StubHub for the resolution of requests which have not been duly completed. StubHub also reserves the right to close the account of any Seller if the Seller repeatedly commits error or non-compliance. Said penalties will be imposed on the Seller under the following circumstances: 
                 
                 <p>The penalties applied by StubHub to the Sellers will always have the form of financial charges. These will be done through the means provided by the Seller as guarantee of the sale or on the total amount of sales pending payment to the Seller. Whichever their form, administrative charges will be applied automatically by StubHub, if and when the Seller falls within the non-compliance stipulated as follows. Penalizations will be charged with any applicable Taxes.
                 <h4>3.10.1 Penalisation for the tardy delivery of Tickets.</h4>
                 <p>Tickets sold must be shipped within 72 hours after the available date that you selected when you published the tickets. In case the tickets are sent after this period, the Seller will be automatically penalized for each package that is delivered late. The economic penalisation for tardy delivery may be consulted at the following link: <u><a href="https://www.stubhub.in/information/penalties" target="_blank">Penalties</a></u>.</p>
                 <p>This charge corresponds to the cost to StubHub for the investigation of the state of the shipment of an order and attending the enquiries of the Buyers. The Seller will receive the value of the order, minus the fee of the sale and the amount of the penalisation for tardy delivery, which is previously indicated. 
                 <p>This penalty fee will not apply in the following cases: 
                
                 <h4>3.10.2	Penalisation for shipment of erroneous tickets accepted by the Buyer.</h4>
                 <p>When the Tickets sent are not exactly those which have been described in the listing, but the Buyer accepts the tickets that have been sent, then an economic penalty for incorrect Tickets will be applied to the order, which will correspond with the amount discounted by StubHub to the Buyer so that they Buyer might accept the erroneous Tickets. This amount discounted by StubHub for the Buyer as compensation will be solely decided by StubHub and directly relinquished to the Buyer. 
                 <p>The Seller will therefore receive the value of the sale minus any fee for the sale, and minus the compensation discount awarded to the Buyer (when applicable). If the Buyer does NOT accept the Tickets offered as substitution, the order will be considered as failed and a "failed order" penalty fee will be applied (see section 3.10.3 below). 
                 <p>The Tickets will be considered as erroneous in the following cases:
                
                 <p>The cases described in the previous points are applied according to the divisions and categories established in the map in Stubhub. In this way, the listings and the Tickets must reflect the divisions and categories of the map of the event as made available by StubHub. If there were no map, the ticket types will be those established by the promoter of the event. 
                 <h4>3.10.3 Penalisations for failed orders.</h4>
                 <p>StubHub considers a failed order as the following cases: 
                 
                 <p>When the Seller fails to ship the Tickets or ships erroneous Tickets that the Buyer does not accept, and StubHub has to give a refund to the Buyer or replace the order with another Seller's tickets, the Seller will not receive the total amount of the sale, and must pay StubHub an economic penalty fee for failed order. 
                 <p>The penalty for failed order will be the result of the difference between the price at which the Tickets were sold and the price of the replacement Tickets, which will be from the same category or better. The minimum amount of the penalisation for Failed Order may be consulted at the following link: <u><a href="https://www.stubhub.in/information/penalties" target="_blank">Penalties</a></u>.</p>
                 <p>The Seller will be able to ask StubHub for the return of the Ticket that was mistakenly sent, only if the Buyer does not accept said Ticket. The amount due for the return of the Tickets to the Seller will be completely at the Sellers expense. Furthermore, in order to exercise the right to a refund, the Buyer must return the erroneous Tickets to StubHub. 
                 <h4>3.11. Delivery of Tickets by the Seller.</h4>
                 <p>The Seller is solely responsible for the pickup of packages for shipment of Tickets that they are offering. Taking into account that delivery processes may vary in accordance with the different delivery services available for use, it is the exclusive responsibility of the Seller to: 
                
                 <p>If there is a problem with delivery and the Seller has failed to keep any delivery receipts or the shipment label has been incorrectly scanned, StubHub will be unable to verify that the package has been picked up and therefore will hold the Seller responsible for the failed order and will apply to the Seller the penalty fees mentioned in the corresponding section about failed sales. 
                 <h4>3.12. Electronic Tickets. (e-Tickets)</h4>
                 <p>If the Seller fails upon sending or uploading the correct tickets as described in the Offer, StubHub will charge them with the corresponding penalties in accordance with the failed delivery. If the Seller uploads or sends by e-mail an invalid PDF file (or a file of another format) or creates their own file by scanning or photocopying paper tickets, this will cause the cancellation of the sale and the corresponding administrative fees will be charged to the Seller. 
                 <h4>3.13. Immediate delivery of the Tickets.</h4>
                 <p>Upon indicating in the Offer that the Tickets are of "immediate delivery", the Seller commits to send them in the 72 hours following the date of the sale. Past these 72 hours, StubHub may cancel the sale with no compensation to the Seller. If the sale is not cancelled, upon the discretion of StubHub, the Seller will be penalized for the delayed delivery of the tickets (the penalization is described in point 3.10.1 of this document). The decision to apply one penalty or another is exclusive to StubHub. Once the "immediate delivery" term is passed (72 hours after the sale), StubHub will decide whether the sale will be cancelled or maintained, applying the corresponding late delivery fee. 
                 <h4>3.14. Amount earned by the Seller in the Transaction.</h4>
                 <p>StubHub will credit the amount due from valid completed transactions by the Seller in the method selected at the moment of making the offer. The liquid amount that StubHub will credit the Seller will be that which was determined at the moment of making the Offer in accordance with section 3.7. 
                 <h4>3.15. Term and conditions of payment to Seller for the transaction.</h4>
                 <p>The sales for passed events are accounted for on the second and fourth working Monday of each month. The order of payment for these sales will be made two working days after said Monday. The period which it takes for one to receive their payment is dependent upon the chosen payment method.</p>
                 <h4>3.16. Closing a StubHub Account.</h4>
                 <p>StubHub reserves the right of admission and exclusion from the Website. Any Seller who is not compliant with the contents of the present Terms and Conditions may be excluded from the Website. The Seller has the obligation to complete all pending orders upon closing the account. StubHub reserves the right to cancel any sale of a Seller when the Sellers account is closed. Once the closing of the account is processed, StubHub will settle all payments due to the Seller, after subtracting the applicable penalty fees due. 
                 <h4>4. Ticket purchase.</h4>
                 <h4>4.1. Acceptance of an Offer.</h4>
                 <p>Any Buyer who is interested in acquiring any of the Tickets offered must expressly accept all Terms and Conditions. Acceptance of the terms of the Offer in question will imply acceptance of the price set by the Seller (the price will be determined solely by the Seller therefore there could be differences in the prices), the cost of the Services rendered by StubHub which will be calculated in accordance with section 3 and any transportation and delivery charges due.

StubHub, will, when possible, inform said changes to the Buyers. Under no circumstances will payments fulfilled by Buyer be refunded. 
                 <p>Acceptance of the Offer initiates the rendering of Services by StubHub to the Buyer. Through this acceptance, the Buyer authorizes StubHub to debit the total amount of the transaction through the payment method offered to that effect in the purchase process, including taxes on the StubHub Services, if applicable, effect at the moment of the acceptance which is levied upon the Services rendered by StubHub. 
                 <p>Buyers are required to pay in the local currency of the Website accessed by the Buyer even if they are buying tickets for an event located in a different country with different local currency.  Therefore, any member of the StubHub group of companies may provide payment processing Services on behalf of any other member of the group.
                 <h4>4.2. Allocation and confirmation of the purchase.</h4>
                 <p>Once the purchase has been made, StubHub will send a pending or confirmation e-mail, depending on the case, to the address facilitated by the Buyer, including the information of the transaction in question. This communication will serve as proof of the transaction between the Buyer and the Seller. Buyers, in the case that they are unable to attend the event, may use the Service once again to Offer the purchased Ticket acquired. 
                 <p>When the Seller fails to follow the Terms and Conditions, and where possible, StubHub will send the Buyer better tickets concluding the purchase in all effects. If the delivery of other tickets is not possible StubHub would proceed with refunding the Buyer through the same system used for payment of the purchase, the amounts previously charged for the Tickets. 
                 <h4>4.3. Price of the Tickets for the Buyer.</h4>

                 <p>Shipment costs are those costs generated by the delivery to the Buyer of the Tickets acquired through the Website in use of the delivery Services indicated.
